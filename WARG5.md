## Package <span style='color:gold;text-transform: lowercase;'>data.table</span> alternatives

- package [data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html) is currently the fastest possible way for large data manipulations in R 

- Hadley's <span style='color:gold';>dplyr</span> is the second fastest but perhaps the first in terms of easy-to-use criterion

- hardly need to learn more than these two for general data manipulation in R

- R base equivalents are usually slow: compare transform() with mutate() or DT[,Z:=X+Y] on some larger dataset
